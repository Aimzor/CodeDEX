print('Hi, it\'s me, past you!\n Today\'s date is November 25th 2024. I don\'t know when I will read this again but I hope it finds me well!\n I\'m feeling very motivated today and hopeful that I have set myself on a path that has shaped your current life. Mum encouraged me yesterday, on the way home from seeing Emily, to carry on with the coding and to use my current free time to focus on it!\n I hope I get good enough to be able to become a software developer, maybe I could even get into game dev??\n Always remember that it\'s never too late to change direction! I promise to try and keep future me in mind when I make choices from now..ðŸ˜…\n Amie x')
